  <title><bold>Flight in Flux:</bold> Analyzing American Bittern
  (Botaurus lentiginosus) Migration Timing and Climate Change</title>
  <sec id="introduction">
    <title><bold>Introduction:</bold></title>
    <p>Climate change poses many questions relating to systems across
    the globe, especially ecological and evolutionary systems. One
    system which could potentially be heavily impacted is migration.
    Bird migration timing is critical for ensuring species survival and
    ecological balance. As anthropogenic climate change has altered
    seasonal patterns, there is a potential disruption to migration
    timing, impacting birds’ breeding success, food availability, and
    overall population health. The American Bittern (Botaurus
    lentiginosus), for example, depends on the thriving vegetation of
    marshlands for camouflage and nesting, as they are known to nest on
    the ground. Wetland birds are expected to be affected negatively by
    a considerable margin with the presence of a changing climate
    altering their regular migratory ranges and patterns (Steen et al.,
    2012).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="abstract">
    <title><bold>Abstract:</bold></title>
    <p>The American Bittern is a solitary, cryptic species that relies
    on wetlands for breeding and overwintering. Typically, these birds
    breed in freshwater marshes across Canada and the northern United
    States before migrating south to the southeastern U.S., Mexico, and
    Central America for the winter. However, increasing global
    temperatures, shifts in precipitation, and habitat loss due to
    climate change threaten to disrupt these migration patterns. Past
    studies on migratory birds indicate that climate change is leading
    to earlier spring arrivals, delayed fall departures, and shifts in
    overall migration routes (La Sorte &amp; Thompson, 2007). For
    wetland-dependent birds like the American Bittern, changes in water
    levels due to altered precipitation cycles could further complicate
    their ability to find suitable stopover sites and breeding grounds.
    Given that wetlands are already among the most threatened ecosystems
    in North America, with significant losses due to urbanization and
    agriculture, climate-induced changes pose an additional challenge
    (Dahl, 2011). Studying the migration patterns of the American
    Bittern under a changing climate is essential for predicting future
    population trends and informing conservation strategies. By
    understanding how climate variables influence their movements,
    conservationists can prioritize habitat protection, restoration, and
    adaptive management to mitigate potential negative impacts.</p>

    <title><bold>Motivation:</bold></title>
    <p>Bird migration range and timing is critical for ensuring species
    survival and ecological balance. However, climate change has altered
    seasonal patterns, potentially disrupting migration timing and
    impacting breeding success, food availability, and overall
    population health. Understanding these shifts can inform
    conservation strategies and mitigate risks to migratory bird
    species. Additionally, information gained from analyzing one species
    can be used to make inferences about the potential shifts in other
    similar species.</p>

      <title>Climate Data Online (NOAA Global Summary of the Month -
      U.S. Specific):</title>
      <p>With NOAA’s Climate Data Online search, we focused on nine
      weather stations located between Arizona (two weather stations:
      Phoenix and Kingsman), California (three weather stations: Lake
      Tahoe, San Diego, and Santa Rosa), Oregon (two weather stations:
      Chiloquin and Hermiston), and Washington (two weather stations
      Shelton and Spokane), to map multiple points of migratory status
      for the American Bittern. The files were requested through eBird,
      and then downloaded into a readable CSV for Excel to initially
      portion the data into the portions necessary for our analysis.
      Each weather station collected data that contained the specific
      information for the weather station, temperature, precipitation,
      and wind-related metrics (of which are negligible for our testing
      metrics).</p>

    <p>To examine the effects climate change will have on the migratory
    timing of the American Bittern, we used a monthly summary of climate
    data from nine recorded NOAA weather stations within Arizona,
    California, Oregon, and Washington and observational data of their
    abundance within those states from eBird.</p>
    <sec id="data-acquiring">
      <title>Data Acquiring:</title>
      <p>Climate data within nine weather stations stretched between
      Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington by NOAA Global Monthly
      Summaries, were recorded on a scale between 1947-2025. By using
      ‘R’ resources, we cleaned this data, removing unnecessary
      attributes for our study, converting units to be consistent
      throughout each dataset, and removing unnecessary data from past
      years to focus on data between 2000-2024.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="data-processing-seasonal-aggregation">
      <title>Data Processing / Seasonal Aggregation:</title>
      <p>Each weather station recorded the seasonal averages of
      temperature and precipitation, which were then manipulated into a
      cleaned version of that data, removing unnecessary wind records.
      With that, we created a list item, using ‘RStudio’, that combined
      the contents of the dataframes, to join them all together,
      ensuring columns and the contents of the dataframes are not
      duplicated or N/Aed. We then integrated a seasonal component into
      the data denoted by month: Winter = 12 (Dec.), 1 (Jan.), 2 (Feb.);
      Spring = 3 (Mar.), 4 (Apr.), 5 (May); Summer = 6 (Jun.), 7 (Jul.),
      8 (Aug.); and Fall = 9 (Sep.), 10 (Oct.), 11 (Nov.). The seasonal
      component was also applied to the American Bittern migration
      dataframe, which was later converted to a tibble for later
      analysis.</p>

      <title>Migratory Timing Analysis of American Bittern:</title>
      <p>Observational data was provided to understand the timing of
      Bitterns within our four selected states, by grouping month and
      year to understand temporal patterns of their appearance based on
      the seasonal presence. Using a time series visualization to detect
      changes within the migratory patterns based on their seasonality

      <title>Comparing Seasonal Trends of Climate Variability and
      Bittern Observation:</title>
      <p>To understand the correlation between seasonal changes for all
      the weather stations, we averaged the temperature and
      precipitation of each month per year. We then evaluated the
      long-term changes in bittern observation from plot layouts used
      before, by visually plotting the changes in the presence of
      climate seasonality.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the influence of climate variability on American
      Bittern observations from 2000 to 2024, we fit a linear mixed
      effects model using the lmer function from the lme4 package in R.
      The response variable was the count of observations per year and
      state. Fixed effects included average temperature (avg_temp) and
      average precipitation (avg_precp), representing climatic
      conditions. To account for non-independence among observations
      across years and states, we included season year and state
      indicators (AZ, CA, OR, and WA) as random intercepts. This
      approach allowed us to control for unobserved heterogeneity due to
      temporal and spatial variation, isolating the effects of climate
      variables on bird observations. All data and observations were
      analyzed using RStudio version 2025.05.0 Build 496.</p>

      <p>During Winter, average temperatures ranged from approximately
      37°F to 47°F, with Bittern observations generally below 1,000
      (Fig. 7). A slight positive trend was noted, suggesting a weak
      relationship between increasing temperature and higher
      observations (Fig. 9). In Spring, temperatures were around 50°F to
      58°F (Fig. 7). Although this season had the highest overall number
      of Bittern observations—with some counts exceeding 2,000—there was
      a slight negative trend in the linear fit, indicating that the
      number of Bittern observations tended to decrease slightly with
      increasing temperature (Fig. 9). Fall showed a moderate positive
      trend, with observations increasing alongside temperatures ranging
      from 52°F to 59°F (Fig. 7). However, overall observations remained
      lower compared to Spring and Summer (Fig. 7). Summer displayed the
      strongest positive trend. As temperatures increased from 67°F to
      74°F, Bittern observations increased significantly (Fig. 9). This
      season also showed more consistent and clustered high
      observations, suggesting a stronger relationship between higher
      temperatures and increased presence of Bitterns (Fig. 9).</p>

    <title><bold>Discussion:</bold></title>
    <p>These results suggest that seasonal temperature plays a variable
    role in Bittern observations, likely reflecting differences in
    migratory behavior, breeding activity, and habitat use throughout
    the year.</p>
    <p>The strong positive trend in Summer may indicate that Bitterns
    are more active or easier to observe during warmer months,
    potentially due to breeding activity or greater availability of
    wetland habitats. Similarly, the positive trend in Fall could
    reflect pre-migration behavior or favorable foraging conditions as
    temperatures cool.</p>
    <p>The Spring season, despite having the highest individual
    observation counts, showed a slight negative trend. This may reflect
    a peak in migration or nesting activity occurring at lower spring
    temperatures, after which observations decline as temperatures
    rise.</p>
    <p>Winter observations were consistently low, which aligns with the
    species’ known migratory behavior—many populations leave colder
    regions during winter months. The weak positive correlation may
    suggest that in relatively milder winters, some individuals remain
    present or return earlier.</p>
    <p>Overall, this analysis underscores how temperature and
    seasonality can influence bird detection and presence. Further
    investigation into habitat variables, precipitation, and food
    availability could clarify the mechanisms behind these seasonal
    patterns. Understanding these relationships is especially important
    in the context of climate change, which may shift seasonal
    temperature regimes and, in turn, influence Bittern migration and
    habitat use.</p>

  (Botaurus lentiginosus) Migration Timing and Climate Change</title>
  <sec id="introduction-nb-article">
    <title><bold>Introduction:</bold></title>
    <p>Climate change poses many questions relating to systems across
    the globe, especially ecological and evolutionary systems. One
    system which could potentially be heavily impacted is migration.
    Bird migration timing is critical for ensuring species survival and
    ecological balance. As anthropogenic climate change has altered
    seasonal patterns, there is a potential disruption to migration
    timing, impacting birds’ breeding success, food availability, and
    overall population health. The American Bittern (Botaurus
    lentiginosus), for example, depends on the thriving vegetation of
    marshlands for camouflage and nesting, as they are known to nest on
    the ground. Wetland birds are expected to be affected negatively by
    a considerable margin with the presence of a changing climate
    altering their regular migratory ranges and patterns (Steen et al.,
    2012).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="abstract-nb-article">
    <title><bold>Abstract:</bold></title>
    <p>The American Bittern is a solitary, cryptic species that relies
    on wetlands for breeding and overwintering. Typically, these birds
    breed in freshwater marshes across Canada and the northern United
    States before migrating south to the southeastern U.S., Mexico, and
    Central America for the winter. However, increasing global
    temperatures, shifts in precipitation, and habitat loss due to
    climate change threaten to disrupt these migration patterns. Past
    studies on migratory birds indicate that climate change is leading
    to earlier spring arrivals, delayed fall departures, and shifts in
    overall migration routes (La Sorte &amp; Thompson, 2007). For
    wetland-dependent birds like the American Bittern, changes in water
    levels due to altered precipitation cycles could further complicate
    their ability to find suitable stopover sites and breeding grounds.
    Given that wetlands are already among the most threatened ecosystems
    in North America, with significant losses due to urbanization and
    agriculture, climate-induced changes pose an additional challenge
    (Dahl, 2011). Studying the migration patterns of the American
    Bittern under a changing climate is essential for predicting future
    population trends and informing conservation strategies. By
    understanding how climate variables influence their movements,
    conservationists can prioritize habitat protection, restoration, and
    adaptive management to mitigate potential negative impacts.</p>

    <p>Bird migration range and timing is critical for ensuring species

    seasonal patterns, potentially disrupting migration timing and
    impacting breeding success, food availability, and overall
    population health. Understanding these shifts can inform
    conservation strategies and mitigate risks to migratory bird
    species. Additionally, information gained from analyzing one species
    can be used to make inferences about the potential shifts in other
    similar species.</p>

      ‘R’ resources, we cleaned this data, removing unnecessary
      attributes for our study, converting units to be consistent

      With that, we created a list item, using ‘RStudio’, that combined
      the contents of the dataframes, to join them all together,
      ensuring columns and the contents of the dataframes are not
      duplicated or N/Aed. We then integrated a seasonal component into
      the data denoted by month: Winter = 12 (Dec.), 1 (Jan.), 2 (Feb.);
      Spring = 3 (Mar.), 4 (Apr.), 5 (May); Summer = 6 (Jun.), 7 (Jul.),
      8 (Aug.); and Fall = 9 (Sep.), 10 (Oct.), 11 (Nov.). The seasonal
      component was also applied to the American Bittern migration

      <title>Comparing Seasonal Trends of Climate Variability and
      Bittern Observation:</title>
      <p>To understand the correlation between seasonal changes for all
      the weather stations, we averaged the temperature and
      precipitation of each month per year. We then evaluated the
      long-term changes in bittern observation from plot layouts used
      before, by visually plotting the changes in the presence of
      climate seasonality.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the influence of climate variability on American
      Bittern observations from 2000 to 2024, we fit a linear mixed
      effects model using the lmer function from the lme4 package in R.
      The response variable was the count of observations per year and
      state. Fixed effects included average temperature (avg_temp) and
      average precipitation (avg_precp), representing climatic
      conditions. To account for non-independence among observations
      across years and states, we included season year and state
      indicators (AZ, CA, OR, and WA) as random intercepts. This
      approach allowed us to control for unobserved heterogeneity due to
      temporal and spatial variation, isolating the effects of climate
      variables on bird observations. All data and observations were
      analyzed using RStudio version 2025.05.0 Build 496.</p>

      <p>During Winter, average temperatures ranged from approximately
      37°F to 47°F, with Bittern observations generally below 1,000
      (Fig. 7). A slight positive trend was noted, suggesting a weak
      relationship between increasing temperature and higher
      observations (Fig. 9). In Spring, temperatures were around 50°F to
      58°F (Fig. 7). Although this season had the highest overall number
      of Bittern observations—with some counts exceeding 2,000—there was
      a slight negative trend in the linear fit, indicating that the
      number of Bittern observations tended to decrease slightly with
      increasing temperature (Fig. 9). Fall showed a moderate positive
      trend, with observations increasing alongside temperatures ranging
      from 52°F to 59°F (Fig. 7). However, overall observations remained
      lower compared to Spring and Summer (Fig. 7). Summer displayed the
      strongest positive trend. As temperatures increased from 67°F to
      74°F, Bittern observations increased significantly (Fig. 9). This
      season also showed more consistent and clustered high
      observations, suggesting a stronger relationship between higher
      temperatures and increased presence of Bitterns (Fig. 9).</p>

    <p>These results suggest that seasonal temperature plays a variable
    role in Bittern observations, likely reflecting differences in
    migratory behavior, breeding activity, and habitat use throughout
    the year.</p>
    <p>The strong positive trend in Summer may indicate that Bitterns
    are more active or easier to observe during warmer months,
    potentially due to breeding activity or greater availability of
    wetland habitats. Similarly, the positive trend in Fall could
    reflect pre-migration behavior or favorable foraging conditions as
    temperatures cool.</p>
    <p>The Spring season, despite having the highest individual
    observation counts, showed a slight negative trend. This may reflect
    a peak in migration or nesting activity occurring at lower spring
    temperatures, after which observations decline as temperatures
    rise.</p>
    <p>Winter observations were consistently low, which aligns with the
    species’ known migratory behavior—many populations leave colder
    regions during winter months. The weak positive correlation may
    suggest that in relatively milder winters, some individuals remain
    present or return earlier.</p>
    <p>Overall, this analysis underscores how temperature and
    seasonality can influence bird detection and presence. Further
    investigation into habitat variables, precipitation, and food
    availability could clarify the mechanisms behind these seasonal
    patterns. Understanding these relationships is especially important
    in the context of climate change, which may shift seasonal
    temperature regimes and, in turn, influence Bittern migration and
    habitat use.</p>
